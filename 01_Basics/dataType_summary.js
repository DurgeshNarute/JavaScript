/*
Depending on how data is stored and accessed, datatypes are majorly categorised in 2 types:
1.Primitive: call by value
  > 7 types : String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt
  > copy is created of the data

  
2.Non-Primitive/ reference type
  > Array, Objects, Functions

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, ie no need to mention the datatype of variables
